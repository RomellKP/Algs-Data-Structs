Projects for Algorithms and Data Structures:

Project 3:
  Description: Linked List and Array List implementation in Java. Implemented the add, clear, get, remove, indexOf, isEmmpty, size, sort, 
  isSorted, equalTo, reverse, merge, rotate, and toString functions.
  
  My Contributions: ArrayList.java, LinkedList.java

Project 4:
  Description: Maze project that creates and solves a 5x5, 5x20, or 20x20 maze based on user input from the terminal.
  
  Run and Compile: Compile and run myMaze.java. From there, follow the instructions in the terminal and use Scanner to type in commands.
  
  My Contributions: MyMaze.java

Project 5:
 Description: Implementation of a hash table with chaining to handle collisions, designed to analyze the efficiency of different hash funtions 
 on the text data. It measures and displays average collision length, longest chain at any index, number of unique tokens, and the distriburtion
 of empty vs. non-empty verticies.

 Run and Compile: Compile and run hashTable.java. Type in the desired .txt file. gettysburg.txt or canterbury.txt will run the general case using 
 the best general case hash function(hash2). keyword.txt will run the specific case using the best specific case hash function(hash3).

 My Contributions: HashTable.java
