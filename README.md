## Project 3:

  ### Description: 
  Linked List and Array List implementation in Java. Implemented the add, clear, get, remove, indexOf, isEmmpty, size, sort, 
  isSorted, equalTo, reverse, merge, rotate, and toString functions.
  
  ### My Contributions: ArrayList.java, LinkedList.java

## Project 4:

  ### Description: 
  Maze project that creates and solves a 5x5, 5x20, or 20x20 maze based on user input from the terminal.
  
  ### How to Run: 
  1. Compile and run myMaze.java
  2. Follow the instructions in the terminal and use Scanner to type in commands.
  
  ### My Contributions: 
  - MyMaze.java

## Project 5:

 ### Description: 
 Implementation of a hash table with chaining to handle collisions, designed to analyze the efficiency of different hash funtions 
 on the text data. It measures and displays average collision length, longest chain at any index, number of unique tokens, and the distriburtion
 of empty vs. non-empty verticies.

 ### How to Run: 
 1. Compile and run hashTable.java
 2. Type in the desired .txt file
 3. gettysburg.txt or canterbury.txt will run the general case using the best general case hash function(hash2). keyword.txt will run the specific case using the best specific case hash function(hash3).

 ### My Contributions: 
 - HashTable.java
